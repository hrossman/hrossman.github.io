    "section": "",
    "text": "[paper] [code]\nAssessing the impact of cesarean delivery (CD) on long-term childhood outcomes is challenging as conducting a randomized controlled trial is rarely feasible and inferring it from observational data may be confounded. Utilizing data from electronic health records of 737,904 births, we defined and emulated a target trial to estimate the effect of CD on predefined long-term pediatric outcomes. Causal effects were estimated using pooled logistic regression and standardized survival curves, leveraging data breadth to account for potential confounders. Diverse sensitivity analyses were performed including replication of results in an external validation set from the UK including 625,044 births. Children born in CD had an increased risk to develop asthma (10-year risk differences (95% CI) 0.64% (0.31, 0.98)), an average treatment effect of 0.10 (0.07–0.12) on body mass index (BMI) z-scores at age 5 years old and 0.92 (0.68–1.14) on the number of respiratory infection events until 5 years of age. A positive 10-year risk difference was also observed for atopy (10-year risk differences (95% CI) 0.74% (-0.06, 1.52)) and allergy 0.47% (-0.32, 1.28)). Increased risk for these outcomes was also observed in the UK cohort. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence on the long-term effects of CD on pediatric morbidity, may assist in the decision to perform CD when not medically indicated and paves the way to future research on the mechanisms underlying these effects and intervention strategies targeting them."

    "text": "[paper]\nThe advantages of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin are well established in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, however, studies that can guide the selection between different DOACs are limited. The aim was to compare the clinical outcomes of treatment with apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran in patients with AF.\nWe conducted a retrospective, nationwide, propensity score-matched-based observational study from Clalit Health Services. Data from 141 992 individuals with AF was used to emulate a target trial for head-to-head comparison of DOACs therapy. Three-matched cohorts of patients assigned to DOACs, from January-2014 through January-2020, were created. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed. Efficacy/safety outcomes were compared using KaplanMeier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. The trial included 56 553 patients (apixaban, n = 35 101; rivaroxaban, n = 15 682; dabigatran, n = 5 770). Mortality and ischaemic stroke rates in patients treated with rivaroxaban were lower compared with apixaban (HR,0.88; 95% CI,0.78–0.99; P,0.037 and HR 0.92; 95% CI,0.86–0.99; P,0.024, respectively). No significant differences in the rates of myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, and overall bleeding were noticed between the different DOACs groups. Patients treated with rivaroxaban demonstrated lower rate of intracranial haemorrhage compared with apixaban (HR,0.86; 95% CI,0.74–1.0; P,0.044). The rate of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with rivaroxaban was higher compared with apixaban (HR, 1.22; 95% CI,1.01–1.44; P, 0.016).\nWe demonstrated significant differences in outcomes between the three studied DOACs. The results emphasize the need for randomized controlled trials that will compare rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran in order to better guide the selection among them."

    "text": "[paper] [code]\nMulti-state survival data are common, and can be used to describe trajectories in diverse applications such as a patient’s health progression through disease states, pickups during the workday of a taxi driver, or a website browsing trajectory to name a few. When faced with such data, a researcher or clinician might seek to characterize the possible transitions between states, their occurrence probabilities, or to predict the trajectory of future observations given various baseline and time-varying individual covariates (features). By fitting a multi-state model, we can learn the hazard for each specific transition, which would later be used to predict future paths. Predicting paths can be used at a single individual level, for example predicting how long a cancer patient will be relapse-free given his current health status, or at what probability will a patient end a trajectory at any of the possible states. At the population level paths predictions can be used, for example, to estimate how many patients which arrive at the emergency-room will need to be admitted, given their covariates. Moreover, their expected hospitalization duration can also be inferred, and provide planners with anticipated patients load."

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the quantification of fundus microvascular characteristics, paving the way for the development of predictive markers for systemic conditions. In this study, we characterize the fundus microvasculature among 8467 healthy individuals, aged 40-70 years. We employ a fully automated segmentation tool to calculate 12 distinct vessel measures, including tortuosity density, vessel density, average width, fractal dimension, distance tortuosity, and curvature tortuosity for both arteries and veins. We provide reference values for these measures by age and sex, and explore the associations between these fundus vessel measures and various clinical features. Our analysis revealed numerous significant correlations, including connections between fundus arterial measures and cardiovascular measurements, lipid profile, sleep apnea indices, glycemic profile, body composition, and smoking status. This comprehensive analysis of fundus microvasculature anatomy in a large healthy population contributes to the growing field of oculomics and highlights the potential of fundus imaging for earlier detection and monitoring of systemic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders."

We present COMPRER, a novel multi-modal, multi-objective pretraining framework which enhances medical-image representation, diagnostic inferences, and prognosis of diseases. COMPRER employs a multi-objective training framework, where each objective introduces distinct knowledge to the model. This includes a multi-modal loss that consolidates information across different imaging modalities; A temporal loss that imparts the ability to discern patterns over time; Medical-measure prediction adds appropriate medical insights; Lastly, reconstruction loss ensures the integrity of image structure within the latent space. Despite the concern that multiple objectives could weaken task performance, our findings show that this combination actually boosts outcomes on certain tasks. Here, we apply this framework to both fundus images and carotid ultrasound, and validate our downstream tasks capabilities by predicting both current and future cardiovascular conditions. COMPRER achieved higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores in evaluating medical conditions compared to existing models on held-out data. On the Out-of-distribution (OOD) UK-Biobank dataset COMPRER maintains favorable performance over well-established models with more parameters, even though these models were trained on 75× more data than COMPRER. In addition, to better assess our model’s performance in contrastive learning, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, providing deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the latent space pairing."

    "text": "[paper]\nPlasma fasting glucose (FG) levels play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes worldwide. Here we investigated FG values using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices in nondiabetic adults aged 40–70 years. FG was measured during 59,565 morning windows of 8,315 individuals (7.16 ± 3.17 days per participant). Mean FG was 96.2 ± 12.87 mg dl−1, rising by 0.234 mg dl−1 per year with age. Intraperson, day-to-day variability expressed as FG standard deviation was 7.52 ± 4.31 mg dl−1. As there are currently no CGM-based criteria for diabetes diagnosis, we analyzed the potential implications of this variability on the classification of glycemic status based on current plasma FG-based diagnostic guidelines. Among 5,328 individuals who would have been considered to have normal FG based on the first FG measurement, 40% and 3% would have been reclassified as having glucose in the prediabetes and diabetes ranges, respectively, based on sequential measurements throughout the study. Finally, we revealed associations between mean FG and various clinical measures. Our findings suggest that careful consideration is necessary when interpreting FG as substantial intraperson variability exists and highlight the potential impact of using CGM data to refine glycemic status assessment."

The phenotypes collected are quantitative traits, providing higher-resolution insights into the genetics of complex phenotypes.\nWe present the results of GWASs and polygenic risk score phenome-wide association studies with 729 clinical phenotypes and 4,043 molecular features from the Human Phenotype Project. This includes clinical traits that have not been previously associated with genetics, including measures from continuous sleep monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring, liver ultrasound, hormonal status, and fundus imaging.\nIn GWAS of 8,706 individuals, we found significant associations between 169 clinical traits and 1,184 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found genes associated with both glycemic control and mental disorders, and we quantify the strength of genetic signals in serum metabolites. In polygenic risk score phenome-wide association studies for clinical traits, we found 16,047 significant associations.\nThe entire set of findings, which we disseminate publicly, provides newfound resolution into the genetic architecture of complex human phenotypes."

Here, we study the ramifications of hospital load due to COVID-19 morbidity on in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 by analyzing records of all 22,636 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Israel from mid-July 2020 to mid-January 2021. We show that even under moderately heavy patient load (&gt;500 countrywide hospitalized severely-ill patients; the Israeli Ministry of Health defined 800 severely-ill patients as the maximum capacity allowing adequate treatment), in-hospital mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 significantly increased compared to periods of lower patient load (250–500 severely-ill patients): 14-day mortality rates were 22.1% (Standard Error 3.1%) higher (mid-September to mid-October) and 27.2% (Standard Error 3.3%) higher (mid-December to mid-January). We further show this higher mortality rate cannot be attributed to changes in the patient population during periods of heavier load."

In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021. We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020. To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities. A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization. This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities. Our analysis demonstrates the real-life effect of a national vaccination campaign on the pandemic dynamics."

We used clinically validated instruments to assess anxiety- and depression-related emotional distress, symptoms, and coping strategies, as well as questions designed to specifically assess COVID-19-related concerns. Higher emotional burden was associated with being female, younger, unemployed, living in high socioeconomic status localities, having prior medical conditions, encountering more people, and experiencing physiological symptoms. Our findings highlight the environmental context and its importance in understanding individual ability to cope with the long-term stressful challenges of the pandemic."

Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential.\nWe devised a model estimating the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions that have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel in its first 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive.\nOur model was validated on a held-out set of individuals from Israel where it achieved an auROC of 0.737 (CI: 0.712–0.759) and auPR of 0.144 (CI: 0.119–0.177) and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel in an independently collected symptom survey dataset from the US, UK, and Sweden. Our analyses revealed interactions between several symptoms and age, suggesting variation in the clinical manifestation of the disease in different age groups.\nOur tool can be used online and without exposure to suspected patients, thus suggesting worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified. Moreover, individuals at high risk for a positive test result can be isolated prior to testing."

Addressing the potential and challenges of big data in healthcare requires an understanding of the characteristics of the data. Here we characterize various properties of medical data, which we refer to as ‘axes’ of data, describe the considerations and tradeoffs taken when such data are generated, and the types of analyses that may achieve the tasks at hand. We then broadly describe the potential and challenges of using big data in healthcare resources, aiming to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the potential of big data resources to advance the understanding of health and disease."

Here, we utilized nationwide surveys that assess COVID-19 associated symptoms to analyze the effect of the lockdown policy in Israel on the prevalence of clinical symptoms in the population. Daily symptom surveys were distributed online and included fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia and Ageusia. A total of 1,456,461 survey responses were analyzed. We defined a single measure of symptoms, Symptoms Average (SA), as the mean number of symptoms reported by responders. Data were collected between March 15th to May 11th, 2020. Notably, following severe lockdown measures, we found that between March 15th and April 20th, SA sharply declined by 83.8%, as did every individual symptom, including the most common symptoms reported by our responders, cough and rhinorrhea andnasal congestion, which decreased by 74.1% and 69.6%, respectively. Individual symptoms exhibit differences in reduction dynamics, suggesting differences in the medical conditions that they represent or in the nature of the symptoms themselves. The reduction in symptoms was observed in all the cities in Israel, and in several stratifications of demographic characteristics. Between April 20th and May 11th, following several subsequent lockdown relief measures, the decrease in SA and individual symptoms halted and they remain relatively stable with no significant change. Overall, these results demonstrate a profound decrease in a variety of clinical symptoms following the implementation of a lockdown in Israel. As our survey symptoms are not specific to COVID-19 infection, this effect likely represents an overall nationwide reduction in the prevalence of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. This quantification may be of major interest for COVID-19 pandemic, as many countries consider implementation of lockdown strategies."

Here we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters and informing epidemiologists, public-health officials and policymakers. We show preliminary results from an Israeli survey of a cumulative number of over 74,000 responses and call for additional countries to join an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data will allow the following: faster detection of spreading zones and patients; acquisition of a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; prediction of future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; and evaluation of the effectiveness of the various social-distancing measures taken and their contribution to reducing the number of symptomatic people. This information could provide a valuable tool for decision-makers in those areas in which strengthening of social-distancing measures is needed and those in which such measures can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with a confirmed patient history of COVID-19, more people report experiencing COVID-19-associated symptoms, which demonstrates the potential utility of our approach for the detection of outbreaks."

Additional discriminative symptoms included self-reported headache and fatigue and a documentation of syncope, rhinorrhea and fever. Children had a significantly shorter disease duration. Several symptoms were reported weeks after recovery. By a unique integration of two datasources, our study shed light on the longitudinal course of symptoms experienced by cases in primary care."

    "text": "[paper]\nIn summary, we call for participation in an international consortium, the CCC, that will serve as a hub for the integration of COVID-19-related information. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak; identifying which factors control the rate of spreading; informing immediate policy decisions; evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control; and providing critical insights on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help people stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease."

    "section": "",
    "text": "[paper]\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses increased risk of short- and long-term complications for mother and offspring1–4. GDM is typically diagnosed at 24–28 weeks of gestation, but earlier detection is desirable as this may prevent or considerably reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes5,6. Here we used a machine-learning approach to predict GDM on retrospective data of 588,622 pregnancies in Israel for which comprehensive electronic health records were available. Our models predict GDM with high accuracy even at pregnancy initiation (area under the receiver operating curve (auROC) = 0.85), substantially outperforming a baseline risk score (auROC = 0.68). We validated our results on both a future validation set and a geographical validation set from the most populated city in Israel, Jerusalem, thereby emulating real-world performance. Interrogating our model, we uncovered previously unreported risk factors, including results of previous pregnancy glucose challenge tests. Finally, we devised a simpler model based on just nine questions that a patient could answer, with only a modest reduction in accuracy (auROC = 0.80). Overall, our models may allow early-stage intervention in high-risk women, as well as a cost-effective screening approach that could avoid the need for glucose tolerance tests by identifying low-risk women. Future prospective studies and studies on additional populations are needed to assess the real-world clinical utility of the model."
