Hi ðŸ‘‹  
I'm Hagai Rossman, a researcher and data scientist with a focus on health data. My interests extend into AI and biomedical data, especially at their intersection.  
Currently, I am part of a stellar team at [Pheno.AI](https://www.pheno.ai/), where we work on projects that lie at the interface of data and health.  
Previously, I was a Ph.D student in Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science, [Segal lab](https://genie.weizmann.ac.il).
