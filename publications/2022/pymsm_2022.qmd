Multi-state survival data are common, and can be used to describe trajectories in diverse
applications such as a patientâ€™s health progression through disease states, pickups during the
workday of a taxi driver, or a website browsing trajectory to name a few. When faced with
such data, a researcher or clinician might seek to characterize the possible transitions between
states, their occurrence probabilities, or to predict the trajectory of future observations given
various baseline and time-varying individual covariates (features). By fitting a multi-state
model, we can learn the hazard for each specific transition, which would later be used to
predict future paths. Predicting paths can be used at a single individual level, for example
predicting how long a cancer patient will be relapse-free given his current health status, or at
what probability will a patient end a trajectory at any of the possible states. At the population
level paths predictions can be used, for example, to estimate how many patients which arrive at
the emergency-room will need to be admitted, given their covariates. Moreover, their expected
hospitalization duration can also be inferred, and provide planners with anticipated patients
load.
