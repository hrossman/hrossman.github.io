In summary, we call for participation in an international consortium, the CCC, that will serve as a hub for the integration of COVID-19-related information. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak; identifying which factors control the rate of spreading; informing immediate policy decisions; evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control; and providing critical insights on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help people stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease.
